# earthquake_data

This program creates a map with Plotly, plotting all the earthquakes across the world in the past 30 days. The visualization features marks that whose 
size are based on the magnitude of the earthquake (the larger the mark, the larger the magnitude). The marks are also colored to reflect
severity.

The picture in this repository provides a quick snapshot of the map created. The data points can be hovered over to see the magnitude and location of the earthquake in question.

The data is taken from the U.S. Geological Survey.
