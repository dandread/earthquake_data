# earthquake_data

This program creates a map with Plotly, plotting all the earthquakes across the world in the past 30 days. The visualization features marks that whose 
size are based on the magnitude of the earthquake (the larger the mark, the larger the magnitude). The marks are also colored to reflect
severity.

The data is taken from the U.S. Geological Survey.
